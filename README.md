## Inspiration
PennyPal was inspired by the need for a personal finance management tool that simplifies tracking income, expenses, and savings goals. It aims to empower users to take control of their finances with ease. ( It is Made for the hacakthon of " Hacking for Agentic Finance "

## How I Built It
I built PennyPal using a combination of the following technologies and tools:
